- 👋 Hi, I’m @franko-dat-tanko
- 👀 I'm interested in technology and coding! I’m also interested in bass house, drum and bass, and trap.
- 🌱 I'm studying software engineering at DigitalCrafts. I'm so stoked! I’m also learning how to compose and produce a UKG track. I'm adding my own spin on it though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites and music.
